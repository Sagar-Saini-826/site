                    <div class="and">The SAINI community 👑 traces its roots to the ancient Surasena dynasty, which was part of the Yaduvanshi lineage, believed to be the same clan from which Lord Krishna descended. This gives the community a strong claim to Kshatriya (warrior class) status in the traditional Hindu varna system. Historical narratives suggest that the SAINIs were originally Rajputs residing in the Mathura region, the capital of the Surasenas. With the advent of repeated foreign invasions, particularly during the Islamic conquests of north India, many Rajput clans were displaced. To preserve their culture and way of life, these displaced warrior clans, including the SAINIs, migrated toward Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and parts of Uttar Pradesh.

                        Over time, these martial families transitioned into agriculture and horticulture, not as a sign of decline, but as a practical adaptation for survival. Despite this shift, the SAINIs 👑 maintained their warrior ethos, participating in regional resistance movements against Mughal and foreign domination.

               </div>Raja Porus is remembered as a symbol of immense bravery and royal dignity in Indian history. His most heroic moment came during the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BCE, when he faced the mighty forces of Alexander the Great. Despite being outnumbered and outmaneuvered, Porus led his army with fearless determination, commanding war elephants and soldiers with remarkable skill. Even after being wounded in battle, he refused to surrender without a fight. When captured and brought before Alexander, his courage shone through—he famously demanded to be treated "like a king," a statement that deeply impressed Alexander. So moved was the Macedonian conqueror by Porus’s valor and pride that he not only spared his life but reinstated him as a ruler, even granting him more territory. Porus’s bravery in the face of overwhelming odds remains a powerful legacy of resistance and honor.

                <div class="and">
               Navdeep Saini is an Indian cricketer renowned for his right-arm fast bowling, representing India across all formats 
               and playing domestically for Delhi and in the IPL for the Rajasthan Royals.
               . Despite limited resources, Saini's talent shone through from a young age, playing tennis-ball cricket in local tournaments.
                His life changed when former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir recognized his raw potential and helped him earn a spot in the Delhi 
                Ranji team. Saini made an immediate impact in domestic cricket, especially in the 2017–18 Ranji Trophy, where he emerged as Delhi’s 
                leading wicket-taker. His pace, often exceeding 145 km/h, earned him a place in the Indian national side. He made a stunning debut in 
                T20Is in 2019, picking up three wickets and winning Man of the Match. Later, he debuted in ODIs and Tests, showcasing his ability to 
                deliver under pressure. In the IPL, he played for Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and currently, the Rajasthan Royals, 
                where he is valued for his death-over expertise and express speed.
